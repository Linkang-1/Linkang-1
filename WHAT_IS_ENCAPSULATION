	//Hiding data behind the getter and setter methods.
	//We use it for data hiding that prevents the user to access the implementation details.
	//This is called information hiding....
	//School bag is one of the most real examples of Encapsulation.
	//e.g. only school bag is visible to other but what inside that school bag is not visible to other.
