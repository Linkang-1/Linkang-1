public class WHAT_IS_POLYMORPHISM {

//	There are two types of polymorphism in Java
//	1. compile-time polymorphism 
//	2. runtime polymorphism. 
//	We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.
//	In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed 
//	in more than one form. 
//	A real-life example of polymorphism is a person at the same time can have different 
//	characteristics. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband and an employee.
